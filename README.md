# Resiliencein2023
The "Resilience in 2023" project analyzes 54 climate adaptation and resilience files from across the United States from the years 2015-2023. It catalogues the strategies within these plans under various categories and sub-categories, serving as a useful reference for the diverse resilience and adaptation actions taken by regions across the US.
