# Resilience in 2023
The "Resilience in 2023" project analyzes 54 climate adaptation and resilience files from across the United States from the years 2015-2023. It catalogues the strategies within these plans under various categories and sub-categories, serving as a useful reference for the diverse resilience and adaptation actions taken by regions across the US.

The file "Resilience in 2023_Strategies" categorizes all the strategies and actions recorded in these plans under 5 main categories. 
The file "Resilience in 2023_SubcategoryCounts" records the number of strategies under each category and subcategory of adaptation actions.
